# 👋 Hello world!  
Welcome to my digital page.

## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me  
I'm Miguel Bettencourt, a 24-year-old software engineer with 1+ years of experience and a background in electrical and computer engineering. 

I'm passionate about robotics, control systems, and the innovative application of AI to solve complex engineering challenges.

🔧 I'm currently developing:  
- Learning and applying the foundations of Data Engineering and Data Science.

## 💼 Experience

**Software Engineer @ Millennium BCP – Enterprise Data Platform**  
*Feb 2024 – Present | Lisbon, Portugal*  
- Contributed to the development and optimization of the data platform of Portugal’s largest private bank.  
- Automated data lineage reporting using large language models (LLMs), saving hundreds of hours on repetitive tasks.  
- Designed and developed an AI service for metadata enrichment, generating descriptions, assigning tags, glossary terms, and domains.  
- Developed a production-ready fraud detection microservice using event-driven architecture and real-time data streams.

**Research Fellow @ Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia**  
*Jan 2023 – Jun 2023 | Lisbon, Portugal*  
- Research grant awarded to support the development of control strategies for underwater optical communication alignment.  
- Worked on maintaining reliable connections in cooperative AUV missions using Extremum Seeking Control techniques at DSOR ISR.

**Collaborator @ Submersible ROV Project (AZORESBOT)**  
*Oct 2019 – Feb 2020 | Ponta Delgada, Azores*  
- Contributed to the design and assembly of a submarine-type robot.  
- Gained practical experience in electronics, sensors, Arduino programming, and teamwork in a multidisciplinary environment.
